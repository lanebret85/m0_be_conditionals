# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

Whenever you need to code for multiple outcomes. If you might want to execute different code depending on one or more factors, conditionals are the way to go.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would make sure not to initialize git into a nested directory of a cloned repo lol. Otherwise, I felt really comfortable with the concepts here and wouldn't change my process.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

Actually, answering the above question and using the words "initialize git into a nested directory of a cloned repo" in a sentence where I know what every word means is pretty cool for me. If someone had said that to me two weeks ago, I would have been really confused and would have asked them to dumb it down for me. Just having some amount of command over the terminology and being able to communicate it is exciting.
